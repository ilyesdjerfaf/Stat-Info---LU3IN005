# This repository contains 3 projects:
- The 1st project aims to study the game of naval battle from a point of view probabilistic. It will initially be a question of studying the combinatorics of the game, then of propose a modeling of the game in order to optimize the chances of a player to win, andvfinally to study a variant of the game more realistic.
- The purpose of the 2nd project is to study the classification methods to which statistics give access naturally. It will therefore be a question of studying the tools of probabilistic classifications. It's good obviously a small part of the set of existing classification methods.
- The objective of the 3rd project is to manipulate Markov chains to study the spread of an epidemic in a population. Your rendering will be a notebook, it is expected that the codes are commented and the results interpreted
